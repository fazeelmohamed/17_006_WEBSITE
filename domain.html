						<li>Packet losses during transmission</li>

					<div class="para">
						<p>TCP has been deployed in the 1980s. Its congestion control is based on the 
						fact that packet losses are mainly due to buffer overthrows and it works quite 
						well in such situations. However, nowadays, many applications use TCP as their 
						transport protocol and hence pass through wireless links, which become common in 
						the Internet. Over these links, packet losses are not due anymore only to overthrows 
						but can also be caused by link errors. TCP, which has no mechanism to distinguish 
						packet loss causes, reduces its rate at each packet loss. This reduction is not 
						justified when there is no congestion and the consequence is that the throughput 
						of TCP over wireless link is lower than what it could be. Research conducted by 
						Ibtissam El Khayat.</p>

					<div class="para">
						<p>TCP (Transmission control protocol) is a reliable, end-to-end transport protocol, 
						which is widely used for data services and is very efficient for wired networks. However, 
						experiments and research showed that TCP's congestion control algorithm performs very poorly 
						over wireless ad hoc networks with degraded throughputs and severe unfairness among flows by Dr. Thomas Kunz.
						In fact, the simplest way to solve congestion is to employ the principle of packet conversation in which the 
						sender stops sending a new packet until the previous one is successfully delivered to the receiver. For this 
						reason, the TCP protocol, one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite, employs the concept of 
						congestion control which dynamically controls the flow of packet inside a network, and prevents network performance 
						collapse. Research conducted by van Jacobson.

						<p>This paper we propose a new scheme that can efficiently deliver multimedia over wireless 
						Internet. Packet losses due to congestion or random error can be distinguished in our scheme. 
						Proper congestion control and error control are performed, which are suited for multimedia 
						applications. Featured with retransmission mechanism, our scheme can also reduce the packet 
						loss ratio caused by fading and random errors, conducted by Fan Yang.

						<p>This paper, they describe the design and implementation of a simple protocol to alleviate 
						this degradation and present the results of several experiments using this protocol. Their aim 
						is to improve the end-to-end performance on networks with wireless links without changing 
						existing TCP implementations at hosts in the fixed network and without recompiling or relinking 
						existing applications. They achieve this by a simple set of modifications to the network-layer 
						(IP) software at the base station. These modifications consist mainly of caching packets and 
						performing local retransmissions across the wireless link by monitoring the acknowledgments to 
						TCP packets generated by the receiver. Their experiments show speedups of up to 20 times over 
						regular TCP in the presence of bit errors on the wireless link. They have also found that their 
						protocol is significantly more robust at dealing with multiple packet losses in a single window 
						as compared to regular TCP. Conducted by Hari Balakrishnan.
						This paper makes two important contributions. First, they design a network-based solution called
						the Window Regulator that maximizes TCP performance for any given buffer size at the congested router. 
						Second, they present a scheduling and buffer sharing algorithm that reduces the latency for short flows 
						while exploiting user diversity, thus allowing the wireless channel to be utilized efficiently.
						This research, explore a new way to make TCP adapt to frequent route changes without relying on 
						feedback from the network. It is based on TCP detecting out-of-order delivery events and inferring route 
						changes from these events. They call it Detection of Out-of-Order and Response (DOOR). Their study has 
						shown that this approach can significantly improve TCP performance over mobile ad-hoc networks.

					<div class="para">
						<p>The performance of TCP degrades over wireless links due to high rate of data losses, which are falsely 
						perceived as network congestion state. TCP performance metrics also diminish due to low data rate, since large 
						delays may occur in last link i.e. wireless link. Similarly in heterogeneous wireless network, packet loss may 
						also occur due to mobility-events that can cause burst-losses, service-disconnection. This motivates to 
						reevaluate TCP control operations and embed some mobility related services to optimize its performance 
						for new generation of wireless networks. TCP for mobile, wireless environment with the help of link-layer 
						triggers which shall be standardized by IEEE 802.21 standard, through its media independent handover (MIH) 
						services. These services are used to detect link layer events in the TCP control operations, and act accordingly 
						to adjust flow and congestion control in a way that does not seriously hamper TCP performance by Muhammad Saeed Akbar.

						<p>Nodes in are distributed and can be statics or mobile. The main advantage of Ad-hoc 
						Networks is that its nodes can be self-organize allowing nodes to connect to each other. 
						The connections between the nodes do not need to establish preexisting infrastructure like 
						other networks. Each node can work as a router to route data to its neighbor nodes. Ad – hoc 
						networks can be used in places that can be difficult to prepare it with infrastructures like

					<div class="para">
						<p>TCP congestion control has an implicit assumption, i.e., any packet loss is due to 
						network congestion. However, this assumption is no longer valid in the ad hoc networks 
						as packet losses may well be due to channel errors, medium contention, and route failures. 
						Several works have pointed out that greedy TCP can result in severe congestion in ad hoc 
						networks and hence performance degradation. Subsequently the TCP source will reduce congestion 
						window size before it becomes excessively large. To avoid congestion, Chen et al. dynamically 
						adjusted the congestion window limit according to path length of TCP flows, a neighborhood RED 
						scheme was proposed to alleviate TCP fairness problem by adjusting marking/dropping probability 
						in light of observed channel information.

						<p>These existing Transport Layer Protocols (TLP’s); mainly TCP since it has a high rate of 
						data packet loss and high retransmission time when operating in wireless networks.
						There are various additions and enhancements of both TCP and UDP, such as Multipath TCP, 
						Datacenter TCP or UDP-Lite. These protocols are often designed for a specific use case or 
						mitigate a common drawback of the original transport protocol. TCP does more than just break 
						things up into packets. It also makes sure that the data arrives, resending packets where 
						necessary. But for a question that fits in a single packet, we don't need all the complexity 
						of TCP to do this. There’s always a demand for reliable information that is accessible in 
						quick successions without having to wait for long. A second delay can cause a lot of damage 
						in a real time.
						All new TCP-like protocols are only modification of basic TCP - Protocols. In them there are 
						no essential changes. The behavior of these new Protocols is more or less good, but all of them 
						have not only advantages but also lacks. Process of replacement is very slow and should be very 
						long.
						We identify the current protocols that are being used in TLP has certain faults/ draw backs that 
						prevents the quick succession of transfer of data or retransmit to serve information to its uses.
						There’s always a demand for reliable information that is accessible in quick successions without
						having to wait for long. A second delay can cause a lot of damage in a real time system.
						In our proposed system we focus to develop a protocol that support minimal packet drops and 
						takes a low retransmission to transmit data in quick successions with in a wireless environment.
						This has been identified as a very important factor in real time systems which are focusing on 
						path navigation applications and other related areas which gather information on critical 
						information like patients, avoid accidents for disabled while providing alternate routes in 
						navigation systems in instances of impediments.
